# Haotian Zhu . Jarvis Consulting

I am Haotian Zhu, who graduated from the University of Alberta in 2020.  I am a versatile software application developer with a passion for learning and delivering on applications with a high-quality standard. I was working on campus as a full-stack developer. My primary responsibility was to develop a restful back-end API and do integrate tests with the front-end. I currently work on Jarvis as a software developer. I have experience using Django, Nodejs, and SpringBoot for the back-end; meanwhile, I am familiar with Reactjs, MongoDB and PostgreSQL. I am a team-oriented person, and I am also a problem solver. I enjoy coding challenges and learning algorithms and data structures.  Currently, I am looking for a great team to provide my skills and learn new tech skills.

Developed SQL script to automatically insert Linux server hardware information into the database. Developed a bash agent program that automatically parses hardware specifications and real-time hard usage data, which is persisted into the PostgreSQL database. It allows the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration team to track and manage a Linux cluster.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HaotianZhu/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Developed a Java application that allows users to create, fetch, and delete Tweets by Twitter API. Designed the project structure and data structure to store the tweet object using MVC pattern and Java Spring framework. Implemented Restful APIs and applied unit and integration tests to them. And then dockerize the program via docker file and deployed it to the server.
  - JDBC App: Developed a Java program that CRUD a customer and order database. Designed and coded Java components to store the table information.
  - Grep App: Implemented a Linux grep program in Java, which allows users to research and find all text patterns recursively within a given folder and write all match text lines in an output text file. Optimized codes by using Java Stream API and lambda. And Deployed the program as a docker image, and users can run this project by docker commands.

**Springboot App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HaotianZhu/tree/master/springboot)]: Developed an online trading simulation platform using SpringBoot and microservice architecture. Designed the layer structure and Java components with MVC pattern and spring framework. Implemented Restful APIs to allow the customers to buy and sell stocks and remotely call the IEXCloud server to update stock market information. Coded integration and unit tests using Junit and Mockito libraries and applied those tests for Restful APIs. Programmed docker files to dockerize and deploy the back-end application and database separately.
