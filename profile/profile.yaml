summary: I am Haotian Zhu, who graduated from the University of Alberta in 2020.  I am a versatile software application developer with a passion for learning and delivering on applications with a high-quality standard. I was working on campus as a full-stack developer. My primary responsibility was to develop a restful back-end API and do integrate tests with the front-end. I currently work on Jarvis as a software developer. I have experience using Django, Nodejs, and SpringBoot for the back-end; meanwhile, I am familiar with Reactjs, MongoDB and PostgreSQL. I am a team-oriented person, and I am also a problem solver. I enjoy coding challenges and learning algorithms and data structures.  Currently, I am looking for a great team to provide my skills and learn new tech skills.
